# Python Math Operations Program


**Welcome to the Python Math Operations program! This simple yet powerful tool lets you perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly from your terminal.**

#### Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3 is Installed
Before you get started, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. To check if Python is installed:

Open Terminal:
On your system, open the terminal or command prompt.

Check Python Version:
Type python --version and press Enter.
You should see something like Python 3.x.x indicating Python 3 is installed.

* [if Python isn’t installed, download it from the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


#### How to Run the Program
Option 1: Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Open Project in VS Code:
Launch VS Code and open the project directory.

*Run the Program*:
Open the terminal within VS Code and type the following command: `python python-math.py`


Option 2: Using Terminal or Command Prompt
Navigate to Project Directory:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

*Run the Program*:
Once in the project directory, run the following command: `python python-math.py`


#### How to Use the Program
Once the program is running, follow these simple steps:

Select an Operation:
You’ll be prompted to choose an operation from the following options:

>addition
>subtraction
>multiplication
>division

Type the operation you want to perform (e.g., addition) and press Enter.

Enter Values:

Enter the first value when prompted.
Enter the second value when prompted.
Note: Ensure that both inputs are numeric. The program will notify you if non-numeric input is detected.

View the Result:
The program will display the result of the operation based on the values you provided.

#### Exiting the Program
To exit the program at any time, simply type exit when prompted to choose an operation. The program will gracefully close with a friendly goodbye message
